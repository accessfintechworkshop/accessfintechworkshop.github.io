        <p>Financial technology (fintech) has a growing impact on economic and social participation due to the increasing adoption of online banking and digital payments in everyday life. As fintech interests emerge in academic and industry work across the globe, critical needs and opportunities arise for ASSETS communities to lead and shape the discourse on accessible fintech.</p>
        <p>The Designing Accessible Financial Technology (accessFinTech) workshop will bring together a diverse group of researchers and practitioners interested in developing a research agenda on designing accessible and inclusive fintech. We will take a timely step towards building a community to support continued discussion on the complex cultural and social contexts around fintech.</p>
        <p>The workshop welcomes participants, including non-researchers, with experience or interests in fintech-related domains. We invite the following submissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Position papers:</strong> including work in progress, pictorials, and artifacts. Up to two pages in ACM two-column format. Submit your position paper via email to <a href="mailto:accessfintechworkshop@gmail.com">accessfintechworkshop@gmail.com</a></li>
